# MERN APP

1. Its a simple MERN app, used to learn what is happening and why its happening. Main goal of this project was to understand concepts.
2. It was a fun and a very good learning experience, moving on from HTML and vanilla JS.

# THINGS TO REMEMBER 

## BACKEND
1. The backend wont run without mongoDB running on the shell, compass doesnt matter.
2. Without a specified schema, DB wont be formed.
3. Important to send the right status code while doing CRUD operations.

## FRONTEND
1. React is very fun and dynamic, easy to cause errors.
2. Right now its not as styled as i would want it to be.
3. Its not the best implementation of what it can be.
