# MERN APP

1. Its a simple MERN app, used to learn what is happening and why its happening. Main goal of this project was to understand concepts.
2. It was a fun and a very learning experience, moving on from HTML and vanilla JS.
3. As an ECE student, its hard to do projects in the software domain. But i tried my best to learn new technologies and make something fun and interesting for myself.

# THINGS TO REMEMBER 

## BACKEND
1. The backend wont run without mongoDB running on the shell, compass doesnt matter.
2. Without a specified schema, DB wont be formed.
3. Important to send the right status code while doing CRUD operations.

## FRONTEND
1. React is very fun and dynamic, easy to cause errors.
2. Right now its not as styled as i would want it to be.
3. Its not the best implementation of what it can be.

# FUTURE IDEAS AND PLANS
1. Right now, anyone can delete anyones entry == ADD MORE SECURITY AND Heirarchial Access
2. Add a landing page.
3. Add dark mode
4. Add some kind of MFA for employee entry.
5. Learn Router more in depth and how express works, what exactly node is

# Honest Thoughts
1. Just a glorified Notes App.
2. Add more styling.
3. Maybe learn how everything is working in detail.
4. Add more security and more tech.
5. Build something from scratch and learn.
6. Do a more advanced project, although a lot is happening, to a user nothing much is happening
